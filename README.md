Hello dear "Developia Engineering Academy" and my dear teacher Emin Azeroglu...

Developia Engineering Academy was the first course I started on my way to becoming a front end developer.


Since I live in Nakhchivan, I participated in this course online.

In this course, I gained a lot of information including "Html", "Css", "Javacsript", "Css Grid", "Tailwind Css", "React JS", "Visual Studio Code", "Github", "Netlify".

Thank you for everything...
